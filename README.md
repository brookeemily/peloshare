## Overview
Peloshare helps indoor cycling enthusiasts find their Peloton fix while away from home by displaying a map of publicly available Peloton bikes. 

## What’s a Peloton bike?
Pelotons are designed to bring the experience of spin class to personal workout equipment. They are stationary bikes equipped with TV screens, allowing users to participate in live &on demand (encore) classes. It’s put perfectly on Peloton’s website:  “We deliver a fully engaging experience with the technology to make every workout effective, and the social connection to make every workout addicting.” 
Data for this map is sourced from Peloton Hotels & OnTheGo Facebook group.

## Motivation
I wanted to make this application because I know how much people love their Peloton. I must admit, I do love a good spin class. I started doing spin a couple of years ago with my sister and fell in love fast. Nothing motivates me more than being around like minded people, the atmosphere of a spin class is the perfect space for me to be in for a workout. Unfortunately, spin classes are very expensive. At the studio I attended, classes cost $25 each, which is reasonable, but simply not maintainable for most people (especially if you want to attend class a few times a week). When my family’s elliptical bit the dust last winter, I convinced my parents to invest in a Peloton & they love it even more than I do. Peloton bikes were created for people who are on-the-go and want to be able to get a good workout in at any time of the day. People become addicted to their workouts on the Peloton and need to find their fix when life takes them away from home for a while.

In the Peloton community Facebook group, people are always asking where they can find a Peloton bike in (insert city here). Whether they’re going on vacation, a business trip, or whatever other kind of trip, they need to be able to get their workout in and a traditional stationary bike isn’t gonna cut it! That’s where Peloshare comes in. Peloshare is a community-powered application that helps users find Peloton bikes wherever they go.
